## SFTP command-line tool
1. In my Terminal I input the command "sftp username@hostname" This loaded a prompt "stfp>".
2. I navigated to the root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/ using cd / followed by cd alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win.
3. Then I uploaded the pictures from my local PC by using the command put /path/to/local/"screenshot".png.
4. After I used the ls command to list out files of my present working directory to confirm I have indeed uploaded the pictures correctly.
5. Lastly I use the comand "exit" to get out of my sandbox environment.
