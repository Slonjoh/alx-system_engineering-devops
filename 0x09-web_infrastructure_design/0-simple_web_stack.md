# Explanation:

## User's Browser:
    Initiates the request to access www.foobar.com.

## DNS Resolution:
    Resolves www.foobar.com to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).

## Domain Registrar and DNS:
    Manages the domain registration and resolves domain names to IP addresses.

## Web Browser:
    Sends the HTTP request to the Internet.

## Internet:
    Transmits the HTTP request to the server at IP 8.8.8.8.

## Server:
    Hosts Nginx, Application Server, and MySQL Database.

    * Nginx (Web Server):
          Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

    * Application Server:
          Executes application code, processes dynamic content.

    * MySQL Database:
          Stores and retrieves data required by the application.

## Specifics About the Infrastructure:

## What is a Server:
    A machine (physical or virtual) that hosts and serves data or services to other computers over a network.

## Role of the Domain Name:
    Provides a human-readable address (www.foobar.com) that maps to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).

## Type of DNS Record www is in www.foobar.com:
    A DNS A record maps the www subdomain to the server's IP.

## Role of the Web Server (Nginx):
    Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

## Role of the Application Server:
    Executes application code, processes dynamic content.

## Role of the Database (MySQL):
    Stores and retrieves data required by the application.

## Communication Between Server and User's Computer:
    Uses the HTTP protocol for communication.

## Issues with the Infrastructure:

    * SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
          The entire infrastructure relies on a single server (8.8.8.8), making it vulnerable to failure.

    * Downtime During Maintenance:
          Deploying new code or performing maintenance on the web server may result in downtime.

    * Cannot Scale with Too Much Incoming Traffic:
          Limited scalability due to the use of a single server. High traffic may lead to performance issues.
