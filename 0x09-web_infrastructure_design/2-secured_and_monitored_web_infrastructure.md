# Explanation:

## User's Browser:
    Initiates the request to access www.foobar.com.

## DNS Resolution:
    Resolves www.foobar.com to the load balancer's IP.

## Domain Registrar and DNS:
    Manages the domain registration and resolves domain names to IP addresses.

## Web Browser:
    Sends the HTTP request to the Internet.

## Internet:
    Transmits the HTTP request to the load balancer.

## Load Balancer (SSL Termination):
    Terminates SSL to decrypt HTTPS traffic before forwarding it to the servers.

## Firewalls (1, 2, 3):
    Provide security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.

## Monitoring Clients:
    Collect performance and health data from servers for analysis.

## Load Balanced Servers with SSL Termination:
    Host Nginx, Application Server, and MySQL Database.

## Specifics About the Infrastructure:

    * For Every Additional Element, Why You Are Adding It:
          Firewalls (1, 2, 3): Enhance security by controlling network traffic.
          SSL Certificate: Ensures encrypted communication between users and the server.
          Monitoring Clients: Collect data for performance analysis and issue detection.

    * What Are Firewalls For:
          Firewalls control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

    * Why Is Traffic Served Over HTTPS:
          HTTPS encrypts data in transit, ensuring secure communication between the user's browser and the server.

    * What Monitoring Is Used For:
          Monitoring tools collect and analyze data to track server performance, identify issues, and optimize resource usage.

    * How Monitoring Tool Is Collecting Data:
          Monitoring clients on each server collect data such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network metrics.
## Monitoring Web Server QPS:
    To monitor the Query Per Second (QPS) of your web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Select a Monitoring Tool:
    * Choose a monitoring tool capable of tracking key performance metrics, including QPS. Popular tools include Prometheus, Grafana, or commercial solutions like New Relic and Datadog.

2. Instrument Your Web Server:
    * Install the monitoring agent or exporter on your web server. This software collects and exports metrics to the monitoring tool.

3. Configure QPS Monitoring:
    * Set up specific metrics for monitoring QPS. For example, track the number of queries processed per second by your web server. This may involve configuring the monitoring tool to scrape relevant data from the server.

4. Create Dashboards:
    * Use the monitoring tool to create dashboards that display QPS metrics in real-time. Visualizing the data allows for better analysis and identification of any anomalies.

5. Set Up Alerts:
    * Establish alerts based on QPS thresholds. If the QPS exceeds predefined limits, the monitoring tool can trigger notifications, allowing you to address potential issues promptly.

6. Regularly Review and Optimize:
    * Periodically review the monitoring data to identify trends and areas for improvement. Optimize server configurations or scale resources if necessary.

## Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

    * Issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer means that traffic between the load balancer and the backend servers is unencrypted. This exposes the internal network to potential security risks.

    * Mitigation: Implement end-to-end encryption by configuring SSL termination on each individual server. This ensures that traffic remains encrypted throughout its entire journey, enhancing security.

2. Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:

    * Issue: A single MySQL server accepting write operations is a single point of failure. If this server fails, write operations cannot proceed, leading to downtime and potential data loss.

    * Mitigation: Implement a MySQL replication setup with a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) configuration. This provides redundancy, allowing read and write operations to be distributed across multiple servers.

3. Having Servers with All the Same Components (Database, Web Server, and Application Server):

    * Issue: Homogeneous servers may lead to a lack of diversity in the infrastructure. If a critical vulnerability affects a specific component, all servers are equally susceptible.

    * Mitigation: Introduce diversity by using different technologies or versions for components. For example, deploy web servers or databases with different software versions to reduce the risk of a widespread issue affecting all servers simultaneously.
